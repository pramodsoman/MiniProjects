        <h3>Expansion Card</h3>
        <p>This project showcases "Expansion Cards," an interactive interface where clicking on a card smoothly expands it to reveal more content, while other cards contract with a smooth         animation. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with HTML providing the structure, CSS handling styling and animations, and JavaScript adding interactivity by toggling classes on click to expand and contract the cards.

        <h3>Split-Landing-Page</h3>
        <p>This project is a dynamic split landing page featuring a captivating stretch-out hover effect, created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
          When the page loads, two separate landing sections are shown side-by-side. Users can move their mouse pointer in between to reveal 75% 
          of one section while concealing the other to 25%. The layout is meticulously planned using HTML and CSS, and JavaScript effectively handles 
          the mousemove events on the divider, ensuring smooth and precise shifting of the sections during drag interactions. 
          The result is an engaging and visually appealing experience achieved through seamless transition effects.

        <h3>Form-Input-Wave</h3>
        <p>A simple login form with animated waving labels. When an input is clicked, the corresponding label's letters slide up and down in a 
          smooth waving motion. This is achieved by using JavaScript to wrap each letter in a span and apply a transition delay to each span,
           offsetting the animation timing to create the wave effect. Specifically, the JavaScript splits the label's innerText into an array,
            maps over each letter to wrap it in a span with a transition delay based on the index, then joins them back together. 
            CSS transitions on the spans animate the smooth up and down motion. The subtle waving effect adds visual interest to a standard 
            login form. Built with HTML, CSS transitions, and JavaScript.
