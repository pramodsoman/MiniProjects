        <h3>Expansion Card</h3>
        <p>This project showcases "Expansion Cards," an interactive interface where clicking on a card smoothly expands it to reveal more content, while other cards contract with a smooth animation. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with HTML providing the structure, CSS handling styling and animations, and JavaScript adding interactivity by toggling classes on click to expand and contract the cards.

        <h3>Split-Landing-Page</h3>
        <p>This project is a dynamic split landing page featuring a captivating stretch-out hover effect, created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
          When the page loads, two separate landing sections are shown side-by-side. Users can move their mouse pointer in between to reveal 75% 
          of one section while concealing the other to 25%. The layout is meticulously planned using HTML and CSS, and JavaScript effectively handles 
          the mousemove events on the divider, ensuring smooth and precise shifting of the sections during drag interactions. 
          The result is an engaging and visually appealing experience achieved through seamless transition effects.

        <h3>Form-Input-Wave</h3>
        <p>A simple login form with animated waving labels. When an input is clicked, the corresponding label's letters slide up and down in a 
          smooth waving motion. This is achieved by using JavaScript to wrap each letter in a span and apply a transition delay to each span,
           offsetting the animation timing to create the wave effect. Specifically, the JavaScript splits the label's innerText into an array,
            maps over each letter to wrap it in a span with a transition delay based on the index, then joins them back together. 
            CSS transitions on the spans animate the smooth up and down motion. The subtle waving effect adds visual interest to a standard 
            login form. Built with HTML, CSS transitions, and JavaScript.

        <h3>Movie Discovery App</h3>
        <p>This is a simple movie discovery web app that allows users to browse and search for movies to see some basic information and overviews.
        </p>
        <h4>Features:</h4>
      <li>It uses the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch popular movies and display them on the homepage.</li>
      <li>The getMovies() function fetches the data from the TMDB API URL and passes it to showMovies() to display each movie.</li>
      <li>For each movie, it displays the title, poster image, vote average, and overview. The CSS stylizes each movie container.</li>
      <li>There is a search bar that allows the user to search for movies by name. The search calls the TMDB search API and displays matching movies.</li>
      <li>The getClassByRate() function assigns a color class to the vote average span based on the rating value. Green for 8+, orange for 5+, red for below 5.</li>
      <li>When a movie poster is clicked, the overview text slides up to reveal more details using a CSS transition.</li>
      <li>The site has a clean, responsive layout using Flexbox that wraps the movies nicely on different screen sizes.</li>
      <p>In summary, this is a simple movie discovery app that allows browsing popular and searching movies using the TMDB API. Users can view basic information and toggle overview details. The code uses asynchronous JS to fetch and render API data. The app has a minimal, easy to use interface with some nice styling effects.</p>
